     <h2>Hollow Knight is a 2D side-scrolling Metroidvania.[11][12] The player controls a silent insectoid protagonist who explores an underground fallen kingdom called Hallownest. The player character can strike enemies with a sword-like weapon called a Nail and can learn spells that allow for long-range attacks.[12][13]

Defeated enemies drop the currency called Geo.[13] The player starts with a limited number of hit points, which are represented by masks.[14] Mask Shards can be collected throughout the game to increase the player's maximum number of masks. By striking enemies, the player character gains Soul, which is stored in the Soul Vessel. If all masks are lost, the player dies and a Shade enemy appears at the approximate location of the player's death. The player loses all Geo and can hold a reduced amount of Soul. Players need to defeat the Shade enemy to recover lost Geo and carry the normal amount of Soul.[14] The game continues from the last visited bench the character sat on, which are scattered throughout the game world and act as save points and places where the player can change their charms. Initially the player can only use Soul to "Focus" and regenerate masks, but as the game progresses, players unlock and collect several offensive spells which consume Soul.[15] Additional Soul Vessels, used to hold more Soul, can be acquired throughout the game.[14]

Many areas feature more challenging enemies and bosses which the player may need to defeat in order to progress further
<br>
<h3>.[13] Defeating some bosses grants the player access to new abilities.[12] Later in the game, players acquire the Dream Nail, a special item that can access the minds of Hallownest's creatures. Hitting most enemies with the Dream Nail deals no damage but gives the player character extra Soul compared to hitting them with the regular Nail. It also enables the player to face more challenging versions of a few bosses and to break the seal to the final boss.[14] If the player defeats the final boss, they are given access to a gamemode called "Steel Soul". In this mode, dying is permanent, i.e. if the player loses all of their masks, the save slot will be reset.[16]

During the game, the player encounters bug-themed non-player characters (NPCs) with whom they can interact. These characters provide information about the plot and lore, offer aid, and sell items or services.[14] The player can upgrade their Nail to deal more damage or find Soul Vessels to carry more Soul. Players acquire items that provide movement abilities including an additional mid-air jump (Monarch Wings), adhering to and jumping off walls (Mantis Claw), a quick dash (Mothwing Cloak), and a speedy super dash (Crystal Heart). The player can learn other combat abilities, known as Nail Arts, and spells. To further customise the player character, players can equip various charms, which can be found or purchased from NPCs. Some of their effects include improved combat abilities or skills, granting more masks with or without the ability to regenerate them with Soul, greater mobility, easier collecting of Geo or Soul, the ability to gain more Geo per enemy, and other transformations to the player character.[12][14] Equipping a charm takes up a certain number of limited slots, called notches.

The Kingdom of Hallownest consists of several large, inter-connected areas with unique themes</h3>
<br>
<h2>.[12] With its nonlinear gameplay Metroidvania design, Hollow Knight does not bind the player to one path nor require them to explore the whole world; there are places that can be missed when finishing the game, though there are obstacles that limit the player's access to various areas. The player may need to acquire a specific movement ability, skill, or item to progress further.[14] To fast travel through the world, the player can use Stag Stations, terminals connected to a network of tunnels that are traversed via giant stag beetles; players can only travel to previously visited and unlocked stations. Other fast travel methods, such as trams, lifts, and the "Dreamgate", are encountered later.[13][17]

As the player enters a new area, they do not have access to the map of their surroundings. They must find Cornifer, the cartographer, to buy a rough map.[b] As the player explores an area, the map becomes more accurate and complete if the Quill has been obtained, although it is updated only when sitting on a bench. The player will need to buy specific items to complete maps, to see points of interest, and to place markers. The player character's position on the map can only be seen if the player has the Wayward Compass charm equipped.[11][13]</h2>
